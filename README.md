C with Classes

I have solved exercises C00 to C04. They include the bonuses, except for C03 and C04.

## C00
This first module of C++ is designed to help you understand the specificities of the language when compared to C. Time to dive into Object-Oriented Programming!

## C01
This module is designed to help you understand memory allocation, references, pointers to members, and the usage of the switch statement in C++.

## C02
This module is designed to help you understand ad-hoc polymorphism, function overloading, and orthodox canonical classes in C++.

## C03
This module is designed to help you understand inheritance in C++.

## C04
This module is designed to help you understand subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces in C++.

## C05
This module is designed to help you understand try/catch and exceptions in C++.
